# Snaykuu-bot

This is a bot made to compete in the annual Snaykuu turnament at my university. The game itself, which is a variant of snake, was made by
a group of students that has now graduated. This, and everyone else's bots, compile into the program and compete to get as much fruit
as possible without being trapped and dying. This bot uses breadth first search along with a few special cases to make its decisions.
